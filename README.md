# terminal-regular-command-with-javascript-and-cpp
I have decided to run all the Linux terminal commands in JavaScript and c++, so stay tuned.

# Prerequisties
* install node
* instal g++ compiler

# Usage 
command | Description | js example | c++ example 
--- | --- | --- | --- |
stat <fileName> | These functions return information about a file(from inode) | node stat.js exampleFile.txt | ./stat.exe exampleFile.txt
